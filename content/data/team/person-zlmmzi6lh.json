My name is Stephen Norman and I am a landscape & lifestyle photographer based in the south west of Western Australia.\n\nI have carried a camera on my shoulder in one way or another for almost 10 years now. This has led me to travel to various countries all over the world, creating photo & video content for clients along the way.\n\nHaving only scratched the surface, I welcome all visitors & potential clients to my journey.\n\n",
