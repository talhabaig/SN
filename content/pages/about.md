      Let me introduce myself from a first person perspective, rather than a
      strange third person depiction.


      Hi there! and thank you for stopping by. My name is Stephen Norman and I
      am a landscape & lifestyle photographer based in the south west of Western
      Australia.


      I have carried a camera on my shoulder in one way or another for almost 10
      years now. This has led me to travel to various countries all over the
      world, creating photo & video content for clients along the way.


      Having only scratched the surface, I welcome all visitors & potential
      clients to my journey.


      Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
